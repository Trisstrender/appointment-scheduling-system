# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Appointment Scheduling System. It covers the different types of tests, testing tools, and best practices for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation. They are fast, focused, and help catch bugs early in the development process.

#### Frontend Unit Tests

- **Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Location**: `frontend/src/**/__tests__/*.test.tsx`
- **Coverage**: Components, hooks, reducers, and utility functions
- **Examples**:
  - Component tests: `NotificationBell.test.tsx`, `NotificationsWidget.test.tsx`
  - Hook tests: `useNotifications.test.ts`
  - Reducer tests: `notificationSlice.test.ts`

#### Backend Unit Tests

- **Framework**: JUnit and Mockito
- **Location**: `backend/src/test/java/VoidSystems/appointment_service`
- **Coverage**: Services, repositories, controllers, and utility classes
- **Examples**:
  - Service tests: `AppointmentServiceTest.java`, `UserServiceTest.java`
  - Controller tests: `AppointmentControllerTest.java`, `UserControllerTest.java`

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. They test the interaction between components and external dependencies.

#### Frontend Integration Tests

- **Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Location**: `frontend/src/**/__tests__/*.test.tsx`
- **Coverage**: Component interactions, API service integration
- **Examples**:
  - Page tests: `ClientDashboardPage.test.tsx`, `ProviderDashboardPage.test.tsx`
  - API service tests: `appointmentService.test.ts`, `notificationService.test.ts`

#### Backend Integration Tests

- **Framework**: Spring Boot Test
- **Location**: `backend/src/test/java/VoidSystems/appointment_service/integration`
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database interactions, security
- **Examples**:
  - API tests: `AppointmentApiTest.java`, `UserApiTest.java`
  - Repository tests: `AppointmentRepositoryTest.java`, `UserRepositoryTest.java`

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify that the entire application works correctly from the user's perspective. They simulate real user interactions and test the application as a whole.

#### Cypress Tests

- **Framework**: Cypress
- **Location**: `cypress/e2e/*.cy.js`
- **Coverage**: User flows, feature functionality, cross-component interactions
- **Examples**:
  - Feature tests: `appointments.cy.js`, `notifications.cy.js`, `services.cy.js`
  - User journey tests: `user-journey.cy.js`
  - Performance tests: `performance.cy.js`
  - Security tests: `security.cy.js`

## Testing Types

### Functional Testing

Functional tests verify that the application behaves as expected and meets the requirements. They focus on the functionality of the application.

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Verify complete user flows

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the application performs well under load and meets performance requirements. They focus on response times, throughput, and resource usage.

- **Load Tests**: Verify performance under expected load
- **Stress Tests**: Verify performance under extreme load
- **Endurance Tests**: Verify performance over time

### Security Testing

Security tests verify that the application is secure and protects user data. They focus on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring proper security controls.

- **Authentication Tests**: Verify user authentication
- **Authorization Tests**: Verify user permissions
- **Input Validation Tests**: Verify protection against injection attacks
- **Header Security Tests**: Verify secure HTTP headers

## Testing Tools

### Frontend Testing

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework

### Backend Testing

- **JUnit**: Java testing framework
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for Java
- **Spring Boot Test**: Testing utilities for Spring Boot applications

### CI/CD Testing

- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Jest Coverage**: Code coverage for frontend tests
- **JaCoCo**: Code coverage for backend tests

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles when possible
2. **Keep Tests Simple**: Each test should verify one thing
3. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should describe what is being tested
4. **Isolate Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services and APIs
6. **Maintain Test Data**: Use fixtures and factories for test data
7. **Run Tests Automatically**: Use CI/CD to run tests on every commit
8. **Monitor Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical code
9. **Review Test Results**: Regularly review test results and fix failing tests
10. **Refactor Tests**: Keep tests clean and maintainable

## Test Execution

### Local Development

```bash
# Frontend unit tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Frontend unit tests with coverage
cd frontend
npm test -- --coverage

# Cypress tests in interactive mode
npm run cypress:open

# Cypress tests in headless mode
npm run cypress:run

# Backend unit tests
cd backend
./mvnw test
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs tests on every commit and pull request. It includes:

1. Frontend unit tests
2. Backend unit tests
3. Cypress end-to-end tests
4. Code coverage reports
5. Security scans

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated automatically and available in the following locations:

- Frontend unit test reports: `frontend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- Backend unit test reports: `backend/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- Cypress test reports: `cypress/reports/index.html`

## Test Monitoring

Test results are monitored through:

1. GitHub Actions dashboard
2. Code coverage reports
3. Test failure notifications

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures that the Appointment Scheduling System is thoroughly tested at all levels. By following these guidelines, we can maintain high quality and reliability throughout the development process.
